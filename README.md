**FrozenLake Environment with Deep Q-Learning in Python Gymnasium**
**Project Overview**
This project focuses on implementing the Deep Q-Learning algorithm to solve the FrozenLake environment provided by the Python Gymnasium library. The FrozenLake environment is a simple gridworld game where the objective is to navigate the agent from the starting state to the goal state without falling into any holes.

**Project Structure**
main.py: The main script that runs the training and evaluation of the agent.
deepqlearning.py: Contains the implementation of the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.
model.py: Defines the neural network model used by the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.
replay_memory.py: Implements the replay memory used by the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.
best_model.pt: Saved weights of the best model.
__pycache__: Python bytecode cache files.
graphs: Directory to store any generated graphs or plots.
wandb: Directory for Weights & Biases logs (if used).

**Getting Started**
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/frozenlake-deepqlearning.git

**Install the dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt
numpy==1.21.2
matplotlib==3.4.3
torch==1.9.0
gymnasium==0.21.0

**Run the main script:**
python main.py

**Usage**
The main.py script allows you to train and evaluate the agent on the FrozenLake environment using the Deep Q-Learning algorithm. You can modify the hyperparameters and the neural network architecture in the deepqlearning.py and model.py files.
